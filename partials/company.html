<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<p>Solving over complicated problems with simple software solutions.</p>

<h2>Origins</h2>

<p>Founded in 2013 mainly as an excuse to manage our own timelines and incorporate more "play" in to our daily routines.</p>

<h2>Getting to know the herd</h2>

<p>An enthusiastic bunch who enjoy exploring possibilities over some warm sake (does that make us Wagyu?). The ability to think outside the pasture has allowed us to apply creative working solutions to a variety of problems where our competitors may spend more time and effort getting the square peg in to the circle hole.</p>
