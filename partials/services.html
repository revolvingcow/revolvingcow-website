<h2>We're limber!</h2>

<p>No matter whether your environment uses Linux, Mac, or Windows we can <span class="highlight">integrate</span> with it. It is not uncommon for us to switch platforms on a daily basis to level up.</p>
<p>This goes for the programming language or framework as well. In the end it all gets compiled to machine code with <span class="highlight">design patterns and practices</span> remaining the same throughout.</p>

<h2>Analyzing your data</h2>

<p>Your business may be operatingly smoothly with investments panning out, but ever wonder why? Or more importantly how can you maintain this groove or give it a boost?</p>
<p>This is where <span class="highlight">data analysis</span> comes in to play. Every computing process leaves a stream of <span class="highlight">metrics</span> in its daily routine. Most of the time this is disregarded as acceptable debris or maybe stored away in some obscure location. By tapping in to this <span class="highlight">untapped source</span> of data your business processes can begin to gather this information. Revolving Cow can <span class="highlight">harvest</span> these nuggets of knowledge and bring about unique insights beneficial to your business and your customers overall experience.</p>
